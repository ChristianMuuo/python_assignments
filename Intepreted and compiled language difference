d) Difference Between Compiled and Interpreted Languages
Compiled Languages:

Translated entirely into machine code before execution using a compiler.

Executed faster because it's pre-compiled.

Examples: C, C++, Go.

Interpreted Languages:

Translated line-by-line at runtime by an interpreter.

Easier to debug but generally slower in execution.

Examples: Python, JavaScript.

âœ… Python is an interpreted language. Its source code is executed line-by-line by the Python interpreter (though it compiles to bytecode internally)
